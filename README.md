RoboLiam is a multi-purpose Discord bot that I originally made for my own server, however, I was asked by many people to make the bot public and so I have.

You can test out, report bugs, or make suggestions at [**RoboLiam Paradise**](https://discord.gg/QFMjF2j), our Discord server.

If you wish to add the bot to your own server, [**click here!**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694637394300895273&permissions=8&scope=bot)
